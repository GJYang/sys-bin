Craig Raw <craig@quirk.co.za>
	assert failure on IPv4Packet.cc:19
	X> drop bad packets earlier in the code

Ronald W. Henderson <rwhalb@nycap.rr.com>
	be able to run and use a filter on an iface with no IPv4 Addr
	X> see how tcpdump calls pcap_compile without the net arg
	if we weren't given a filter, dont' try to compile one
	X> already added an if() around the filter compile code

James E. Hopper <JAMES.E.HOPPER@saic.com>
Chuck Schied <chuck@randomnimity.org>
	missing pthread_*_init calls... causes probs on OSX and FBSD. 
	X> Chuck sent a patch. apply.

Niels Burmeister <niels.burmeister@gmx.de>
	seeing connections stuck in the CLOSING state. 
	X> add timeout?
	X> review TCPConnection state machine code

	0.6.2 compile probs... already documented in README
	-> make configure barf if broken libpcap 0.6.2 or earlier detected

* make ChangeLog a change log, NEWS is for news.



-- done for 1.1.0 --

* make configure see if 'using namespace __gnu_cxx;' works... then ifdef to
	taste.

* add NLP parameter to NetworkPacket::newPacket

* add code to transfer exceptions between threads (to TCPTrack)

* make configure check for stl includes

* only works on ethernet interfaces
	works on linux_sll ifaces now... (ppp,tun,lo)

* abort if terminal is too small

* clopt: closed connections remove timeout

* make real hash funcs for Guesser and TCContainer

* Be able to pick up connections that we didn't see the SYN for

* make UI scrollable list, using curses pad, maybe

* icmd: s: enable/disable sorting

* icmd: p: don't remove closed cons, no new cons

* clean up status display (sorted/paused flags)

* dont call exit() from within objects, throw an exception or something

* clean close down... stop curses nicely

* put stuff in main in an app class

* Idle time display hours/minutes



-- >= 1.2.0 ----

separate up/down speeds

calculate averages over an arbitrary range of time... or lifetime of conn.

bits/bytes sec flag

exit immediately

allow averages to be calculated over an arbitrary period (extend fastmode)

clopt: no sorting

clopt: units (B/s KB/s) -- probably need gui

complete error checking on every sys/lib call
 -- PacketBuffer and Sniffer have this, others can wait.

display all non-TCP/IPv4 bandwidth usage somewhere

tcp round trip time (latency)

network hops between endpoints (ttl ip field)

replay tcpdump captures

make UI occupy full window size horizontally

make debug log allow format string like printf

make configure look for pcap/pcap.h and if found, add -I/usr/include/pcap or
something like that to compilation. might fix redhat packaging issue

duplicate excess -I in compilation

etherreal extension?

GUI

use etherreal app payload interpreters

logging

DNS lookups

html output?

bi-directional bandwidth counters
