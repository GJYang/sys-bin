* 1.4.0 released 2010-sep-28
- Incorporated patches from Kristof Provost for IPv6 support and numerous
  cleanups and bug fixes. An issue where tcptrack would run but not display
  any connections should now be fixed. Thanks to Ronald W. Henderson for
  help testing and debugging.

* 1.3.0 released 2007-feb-06
- New sort options: unsorted, sort by rate, sort by byte count. Thanks to
  Zach Bagnall for the patch.

* 1.2.0 released 2006-dec-20
- Fixes for compiling on gcc 4.1+ (thanks to Dries Verachtert, Christian
  Weiss)
- 802.1q VLAN support (thanks to Adam Osuchowski)

* 1.1.5 released 2005-mar-12
- Fixed a bug where tcptrack would crash due to a floating point exception
  if it sniffed TCP packets with source or destination ports of 0.

* 1.1.4 released 2004-oct-10
- Fixed a memory leak in the TCPConnection class.

* 1.1.3 released 2004-aug-16 
- Added a total for the speed column at the bottom of the display. Thanks to
  Leo Costela for the patch.
- Fixed a few minor user interface bugs (mostly exposed by the above patch).

* 1.1.2 released 2004-jun-03
- Fixed assertion an assertion failure (in IPv4Packet.cc) bug.
- tcptrack can now run on interfaces with no IPv4 addresses (ie, stealth
  interfaces).
- Fixed a few crashes and assertion failures on Mac OSX and FreeBSD caused
  by missing pthread_*_init calls. Thanks to Chuck Schied for the patch.
- Added a timeout for connections in the CLOSING state. Connections may get
  stuck in that state due to dropped packets, timeouts by the peers, or
  there may be a bug in the TCPConnection state machine code that I haven't
  found yet.
- ChangeLog is now a regular ChangeLog, not a development log. The contents
  of this file were previously in the NEWS file. NEWS will now contain
  the same stuff that's on the web page.

* 1.1.1 released 2004-may-10
- Fixed problem where tcptrack would silently not work on certain ppp
  connections (a.k.a. debian bug #245227)
- Added support for NULL and RAW pcap interface types. tcptrack should now
  work on all linux PPP, ethernet, tun/tap and local loopback interfaces.
- tcptrack now compiles properly with gcc 3.4. Thanks to Jim Gifford.
- Added EXAMPLES section to man page and a few extra notes to man page about
  guessing, pause/sort options.

* 1.1.0 released 2004-apr-18 
- Fixed problems with crashes on FreeBSD and Solaris. Stack sizes of certain
  threads were too small (adjustable in defs.h).

* 1.1.beta1 released 2004-mar-31
- Idle time can be computed & updated more than once a second now and may be 
  more accurate under heavy load. See the man page for more info.
- Idle time now displays hours/minutes instead of always seconds.
- tcptrack can now see connections that were started before tcptrack was.
- Added -d option to disable connection detection (above).
- List of connections is now scrollable with arrow keys. 
- Added pause/unpause and enable/disable sort options
- Added status display for number of connections shown and total and pause /
  sort options
- tcptrack now exits cleaner
- internal data structures changed to make tcptrack more CPU efficient.
- lots of internal code changes to make code more organized and reusable.
- More error handling added.
- Added -p option to enable/disable promisc mode
- Sorting is now done by speed first, least idle time second. Before, idle 
  time was not factored in the sorting.
- Stack size of each thread reduced. configurable in defs.h. tcptrack now
  uses a lot less virtual address space.

* 1.0.2 released 2003-dec-04
- Fixed some Solaris build issues
- configure script updated 
- Fixed assert compile problem on some systems

* 1.0.1 released 2003-nov-27
- Fixed a memory leak
- fixed a problem that would cause tcptrack to segfault under heavy load
- tcptrack no longer grabs packet payloads off of the network, making it
  more efficient (especially in terms of memory under heavy load).
- FreeBSD (and probably other BSD) timing issues have been fixed.
- New timing options controllable in defs.h
- tcptrack only works on ethernet interfaces for now. It will now fail to
  start up on non-ethernet interfaces and print an error.
- tcptrack still won't compile on Solaris. I'm working on getting access to
  a Solaris machine to test on.

* 1.0.0 released 2003-nov-23
- First public release.
