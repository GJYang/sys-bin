Requirements
------------
	
	libpcap 0.7.2 or higher. 

	You can use earlier versions if you hack your libpcap include files
	to fix a minor C++ bug in the pcap.h header file as described in
	README.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

	To build and install:

		./configure
		make
		make install

	Run ./configure --help to see a list of options to change things
	like the installation directory.

	If configure tells you you don't have pcap.h when you do, or if make
	fails with previous declaration errors, see README.

Using
-----

	To run tcptrack, you need to specify an interface for it to sniff:

		tcptrack -i eth0

	You can also provide a pcap filter expression:
	
		tcptrack -i eth0 src or dst 192.168.33.92 and port 80
		
	That will make tcptrack only monitor web connections to or from
	192.168.33.92 on eth0. The expression syntax is the same as you'd
	use for tcpdump and possibly other pcap-based sniffers.
	
	While in tcptrack, hit 'q' to exit. See the man page, tcptrack(1),
	for more information on options and interactive commands.
